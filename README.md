# Project Euler Solutions

## Description

This repository has solutions to some problems of Project Euler.

We sorted the problems by their number of solutions and started
solving some of them in R, Python, Julia and Scala.

## Strategy

We value simplicity, memory efficiency, speed optimization, and - as much 
as possible - using only built-in functions.

R doesnâ€™t support large integers and for this we had to use the package `gmp`.
