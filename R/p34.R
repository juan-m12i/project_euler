# 145 is a curious number, as 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145.

# Find the sum of all numbers which are equal to the sum of the
# factorial of their digits.
# 
# Note: as 1! = 1 and 2! = 2 are not sums they are not included.

# A Curious Number is also known as a factorion.
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorion
# In this article they say that there are just 4 factorions (in base 10).

# The difficulty is to find an upper bound.
# We know n is natural and if it has d digits, then
# 10^(d-1) <= n <= 9! * d
# this fails for d >= 8 thus n has at most 7 digits
# and a first upper bound could be 9999999
# but the maximum sum of a number with 7 digits is 9! * 7
# thus this becomes a second upper bound

upper_bound <- factorial(9) * 7

  if (sum(factorial(get_digits(nr))) == nr) {
