# Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:
#
# n^2 + n + 41
#
# It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the
# consecutive values n = 0 to 39. However, when n = 40,
# 40^2 + 40 + 41 = 40(40 + 1) + 41 is divisible by 41,
# and certainly when n = 41, 41^2 + 41 + 41 is clearly divisible by 41.
#
# The incredible formula  n^2 − 79n + 1601 was discovered,
# which produces 80 primes for the consecutive values n = 0 to 79.
# The product of the coefficients, −79 and 1601, is −126479.
#
# Considering quadratics of the form:
# n^2 + an + b, where |a| < 1000 and |b| < 1000
#
# where |n| is the modulus/absolute value of n
# e.g. |11| = 11 and |−4| = 4
# Find the product of the coefficients, a and b, for the
# quadratic expression that produces the maximum number of
# primes for consecutive values of n, starting with n = 0.
