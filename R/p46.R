# 46 | Goldbach's other conjecture
# https://projecteuler.net/problem=46
# 
# It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number 
# can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.
# 
# 9  =  7 + 2 × 1^2
# 15 =  7 + 2 × 2^2
# 21 =  3 + 2 × 3^2
# 25 =  7 + 2 × 3^2
# 27 = 19 + 2 × 2^2
# 33 = 31 + 2 × 1^2
# 
# It turns out that the conjecture was false.
# 
# What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the
# sum of a prime and twice a square?

# Is odd
# Is a composite, thus it's not prime
