# 33 | Digit cancelling fractions

# 
# The fraction 49/98 is a curious fraction, as an inexperienced
# mathematician in attempting to simplify it may incorrectly believe 
# that 49/98 = 4/8, which is correct, is obtained by cancelling the 9s.
# 
# We shall consider fractions like, 30/50 = 3/5, to be trivial examples.
# 
# There are exactly four non-trivial examples of this type of fraction,
# less than one in value, and containing two digits in the numerator
# and denominator.
# 
# If the product of these four fractions is given in its lowest common terms, 
# find the value of the denominator.
# 

# There is a nice explanation of this at:
# http://www.roberthorvick.com/2012/07/20/project-euler-problem-33-explained/

# We need to find the 4 non-trivial fractions and 49 / 98 is one of them.
# The other 3 have the following constrains:
# - Both numerator and denominator have 2 digits.
# - The fraction is smaller than 1.
# - They are not mod 10.
